Beyond SIDH: A survey on countermeasures and new constructions

    =====
	This report explores isogeny-based cryptography, with a particular focus on the Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) protocol and its vulnerabilities. 

    Part I presents the fundamental concepts of elliptic curves and isogenies, required for a detailed presentation of the SIDH key exchange mechanism and the attacks that allowed to break it in polynomial time in the Summer of 2022.

    Part II introduces countermeasures and new cryptographic constructions developed in response to these attacks. Specifically, it examines M-SIDH, MD-SIDH, and innovative schemes such as FESTA and POKE, which leverage the SIDH attacks constructively to build Public-Key encryption schemes. 

    The report aims to elucidate complex aspects of isogeny-based cryptography and provide a comprehensive resource for those interested in this promising field, that is a strong candidate for achieving quantum-resistant cryptographic solutions.
