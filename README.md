# Research Project: “Beyond SIDH: A Survey on Countermeasures and New Constructions”

Repository for my research project titled “Beyond SIDH: A Survey on Countermeasures and New Constructions”, which was conducted during the Spring semester of 2024. 

This project explores recent developments and responses to the cryptographic challenges posed by attacks on the Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) protocol. 

It includes a comprehensive survey of various countermeasures to those attacks as well as potential new cryptographic protocols obtained by leveraging the attacks in a constructive manner.

## Supervision and collaboration

This research project was carried out under the guidance and supervision of the [Security and Cryptography Laboratory (LASEC)](https://lasec.epfl.ch/) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). 

I had the privilege of being supervised by Professor Serge Vaudenay and working closely with PhD student Laurane Marco.

## Repository overview

This repository contains the key deliverables associated with the research project, providing a structured and accessible overview of the work:
- `abstract.md`: A concise summary that outlines the key objectives, scope, and outcomes of the project. This abstract serves as an introduction for readers interested in the main focus of the research.
- `report.pdf`: The final detailed report, presenting a thorough analysis of SIDH vulnerabilities, existing countermeasures, and potential alternative constructions. It includes technical discussions, literature reviews, and conclusions based on my research findings.
- `slides.pdf`: The slide deck used during my final presentation. These slides provide a high-level overview of the project, summarizing key insights and results in a visually engaging format.

## Purpose and motivation

This project was inspired by recent cryptographic breakthroughs that have challenged the security assumptions of the SIDH protocol, specifically following the devastating attacks published in late 2022. 

The goal of this research is to contribute to the cryptography community’s understanding of these developments by surveying existing countermeasures and proposing new directions for cryptographic construction beyond SIDH.
